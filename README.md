# Installation Notes
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. Only basic python libraries have been used, all are listed below: -

    * Pandas
    * Numpy
    * MatplotLib
    * sikit learn marchine learning lib

# Project Aims and Motivation
This project will convert raw data from the worldbank.org website and shape to build a decision tree classifier that predicts if a countries GDP will be growing. The specific questions covered are:- 

1) Can we create features from the time series data, capturing the information into a single column variable. Is this enough for accurate classification? 
2) What are the key variables that predict if a country will have GDP growth. 
3) Can we measure performance for this and which metrics best measure the model performance ? 

It should be noted that the GDP figures were also taken from the worldbank website, which we developed a rule for the classification. The rule was the country needed to show GDP growth of 1.5% over at least 3 years to be classified as growing (1) or not (0). So the classification was a binary varaible and yes, we could have identified this easily from the given data. However, the purpose of the exercise was to create features, create a rule for the classification of GDP and then create a model around that. 


# Files 
Main file used was the data.ipynb which was coded in VS code.

# Licencing / Other Info
This data was taken from the worldbank.org website from various searches based around economic and societal indicators. Data is free to use from the website www.worldbank.org


## Project Motivation 📈
Why do some countries stagnate while others grow? This project uses World Bank data to determine if societal "health" indicators (like Fertility and Life Expectancy) are predictive of economic performance. 

## The "1.5% Rule"
Instead of simple regression, I engineered a binary classification target:
- **Class 1 (Growing):** Countries showing ≥ 1.5% annual GDP growth for at least 3 years between 2013-2023.
- **Class 0 (Stagnant):** Countries failing to meet this threshold.

## Key Findings
- **The Most Predictive Feature:** [Insert your top feature here, e.g., Life Expectancy].
- **Model Performance:** The Decision Tree achieved an accuracy of [X%], proving that societal indicators are indeed strong proxies for economic potential.
